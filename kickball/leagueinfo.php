							Founded in June of 2013, the Rastahorn.com Kickball League brought together people
							from various backgrounds to compete on common ground: kickball. What began
							amongst friends as a weekly pick-up game, soon became the focal point of more than
							20 people\'s weeks. With such high demand for more kickball, the league will commence
							it\'s first official season in September 2013, expanding upon the players who
							put left heart, blood and soul on the field all summer. Team Gangstabread and L.L.
							Kool-Aid will be joined with two expansion teams, collecting the next batch of talent
							in the kickball hotbed of Burlington, Vermont.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							The League\'s unique incorporation of drinking truly creates a challenging, yet fun
							and competitive game amongst atheletes and friends alike.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							The future is bright for Rastaball, and the league looks to expand more and more as
							the seasons come and go. For information on the League, or how to inquire about
							joining with a team of your own; contact <a href="mailto:kickball@rastahorn.com">kickball@rastahorn.com</a>
